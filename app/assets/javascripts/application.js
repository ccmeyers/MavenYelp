// Looking for this app's javascript?
// You're barking up the wrong tree! (no pun intended)
// I broke up with the asset pipeline and now use webpack to compile assets
// All javascript files are in `app/frontend/javascripts/`
// and are compiled into `bundle.js`
// which is thrown into `app/assets/javascripts/` when you run webpack
